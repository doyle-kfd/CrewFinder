# CrewFinder

**CrewFinder** is a fictitious platform designed to connect captains and crew members in the sailing community. Whether you're a captain searching for crew to join your voyage or a sailor looking for exciting opportunities on the water, CrewFinder helps bring people together. With its simple and intuitive design, the platform makes it easy to create or apply for sailing trips.

This project was developed as part of a portfolio to showcase full-stack development skills. While itâ€™s not a real application, CrewFinder demonstrates how captains and crew members could collaborate effortlessly through features like trip listings, applications, and profile management. Explore the possibilities of what such a platform could achieve!
